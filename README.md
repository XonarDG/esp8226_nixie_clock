## Info

This is a small project for a simple nixie clock using a ESP8266 development board. **WIP! USE AS REFERENCE ONLY!**

## Why?
Like many others, I've fallen for the look of nixies way before this project began. At the time I thought I wasn't capable of a project like this, but in late 2021 I made my first prototype using MH74141 and Tesla ZM1020 nixies. It was rough, didn't work properly and was on a protoboard, but it motivated me into doing more.

In 2024 I made the decision to make this my high school graduation project and this is what came out of it. It still has rough edges here and there, but it works, and it has a somewhat complete enclosure.

At this point I thought it would be a nice touch making the project publicly available. That said its far from done, and I would not recommend making this project on your own.
